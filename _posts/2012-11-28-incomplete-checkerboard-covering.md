Cover aÂ checkerboard that has one corner square missing. The size of the board is usuall 2**k, use recursive way the board will be

divided into four 2**(k-1) size small board. Cover the center board with a L shape tile, the one fourth board will the same as the original board.

(r, c) is the left top corner coordinate. s is size / 2.

```python
tile = 0 # global variable for the L shape tile counting


def cover(board, brow, bcol, mrow, mcol, size):
  '''
      brow, bcol is the board's up left corner coordinate
      mrow, mcol is the missing tile's coordinate
      size is the board size
      2**k size board will be divided to four 2**(k-1) size sub-board
      if the missing tile is one fourth board, the L shape will be put
      in the other three one fourth board's center corner

    if size is 1:
        return

    global tile
